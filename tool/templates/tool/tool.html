      <h2>G model</h2>
      <p>
        The Gravity model (G), proposed by George K. Zipf in 1946, was the first
        successful model to be interested in migratory flows. It is based on the
        idea that the number of travelers between two places, defined as flow,
        increases as the population of origin and destination increases and
        decreases as the distance between the two places increases.

      <h2>DG model</h2>
      <p>
        The Deep Gravity model (DG), developed by the Institute of Information
        Science and Technologies of the National Research Council in
        collaboration with Fondazione Bruno Kessler of Trento and with the
        Argonne National Laboratory of the USA on November 12, 2021, is a model
        suitable for predicting mobility flows. Through the greater capacity for
        generalization and the absence of input historical data, Deep Gravity
        was able to generate realistic flows even for regions for which no data
        was available during the training phase.

      <h2>NG model</h2>
      <p>
        The Nonlinear Gravity model (NG) uses a feed-forward neural network
        combined with the Deep Gravity structure, having, however, input
        characteristics, namely population and distance, similar to the Gravity
        model.

      <h2>MFG model</h2>
      <p>
        The Multi-Feature Gravity model (MFG) uses the same features and
        geographic variables input to Deep Gravity, extracted from OneStreetMap,
        but varies in processing time. The input will be processed by a
        single-layer linear neural network.
