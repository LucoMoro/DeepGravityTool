  <p>
    Now, it is possible to run the other three algorithms (for more informations
    <a href="{% url 'experiments'%}" class="a-link">click here</a>). In case the
    other three algorithms have been previously run it is possible to execute
    the file "plots.ipynb" to graphically view the results of the algorithm by
    <a href="{% url 'plot_results' %}" class="a-link">here</a>, or it is
    possible to view the results in excel form in the DeepGravity “results”
    folder.

    In case you want to rerun the algorithms it is possible by clicking

    <a href="{% url 'how_to_use' %}" class="a-link">here shown</a>, or that the
    web app has been correctly run in the same enviroment in which is installed
    DeepGravity. For more information
