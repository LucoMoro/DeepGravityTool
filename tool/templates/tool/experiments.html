    It is finally possible to run the algorithm. For how it has been programmed,
    DeepGravity allows not only to run DG, but also allows to run the other
    three algorithms: NG, MFG e G, briefly explained
    <a href="{% url 'home' %}" class="a-link">here</a>. Their execution is
    useful for the comparison of the results produced by DeepGravity with other
    algorithms, capable of working on similar dataset:
  </p>
  <ul class="ul-setup">
    <li><a href="{%  url 'dg_results' %}" class="a-link">run DG</a></li>
    <li><a href="{%  url 'g_results' %}" class="a-link">run G</a></li>
    <li><a href="{%  url 'ng_results' %}" class="a-link">run NG</a></li>
    <li><a href="{%  url 'mfg_results' %}" class="a-link">run MFG</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In case you want to run all four of the algorithms it is possible by
    clicking
    <a href="{%  url 'all_results' %}" class="a-link">here</a>.

    <b class="li-item">To notice: </b> Running an algorithm, the page of the
    occured success will be uploaded only at the end of the run of the same. So
    it is normal that the page takes time to upload. It is also not recommended,
    even if possible, to run different operations whilst waiting for the page to
    run the algorithm. This infact could lead to an error during the run phase
    of the algorithm.
